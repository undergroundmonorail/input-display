# Sticky Viewer
simple fightstick input viewer

appears always on top and at the bottom center of your display. very little configuration is possible atm but watch this space

currently supports only five buttons and only left and right stick directions, because i play fs and that's just the way it is i guess

fightstick with no inputs:

a configuration file for button remapping and image files for customization are provided. if they're missing at runtime, the program defaults to the default values and images

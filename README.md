# Sticky Viewer

A simple XInput input viewer designed for fightsticks. Appears always-on-top.

Currently, configuration is quite limited. Check ROADMAP.md for planned updates. Most notably, exactly five remappable buttons and only left and right stick directions are supported right now, because I play Fantasy Strike and that was my priority. :P

To remap buttons, open sticky_viewer.exe.config and modify the values there. If the configuration file is missing at runtime, the values used in the unmodified file are the defaults.

## Screenshots

The images composing the stick and button visuals are provided and can be customized. If they're missing at runtime, these defaults are used.
